                        <h3>Manuel Testing</h3>
                        <p>Manual testing is a fundamental aspect of software quality assurance. Despite the rise of
                            automation, manual testing remains crucial for scenarios where human intuition, creativity,
                            and exploratory skills are required. This guide explores the principles, techniques, and
                            best practices of manual testing, equipping you with the knowledge to ensure that your
                            software meets the highest standards of quality.

                        <h3>Automation Testing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Automation testing is the process of using specialized software tools to execute tests on a
                            software application automatically, comparing the actual outcomes with the expected results.
                            This is in contrast to manual testing, where a human tester manually executes test cases.
                            Automation testing is especially useful for repetitive tasks, regression testing, and
                            scenarios that require multiple data sets or extensive user interactions.
